# Recurrent Neural Network and a Hybrid Model for Prediction of Stock Returns
This piece of work is based on Dr.Rather's paper of **_Recurrent Neural Network and a Hybrid Model for Prediction of Stock Returns (2015)_**.  [Availabe Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417414007684)

## Overview

This project consists of three models. A linear Autoregression (AR) model, a Autoregression Moving Referece Recurrent Neural Network (AR-MRNN) model, and a Hybird Prediction Model (HPM) as in Rather's paper.

Source codes for above models in three separate files: **AR.py**, **RNN.py** and **HPM.py**.

Dataset is in the folder of **Data**, which include of daily historical data of six stocks from **02/01/2007** to **26/03/2010**. 

Data are downloaded from National Stock Exchange of India (https://www.nseindia.com)
